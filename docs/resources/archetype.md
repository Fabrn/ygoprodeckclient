# Archetype

This resource represents a Card Archetype. Archetypes are not officially defined by Konami
and are maintained by YgoProDeck. You can give them feedback [here](https://github.com/AlanOC91/YGOPRODeck/issues/10).

The only available property for the `Archetype` resource is `name`, which is a string
representing the actual name of the archetype.
